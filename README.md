# Mask-Detection-using-ML
This is a Mask detection Programming using python programming
language which can be used in your final year project as if 
we are in this pandemic situation what would be a better way to utilize it by making a model stand out to be tall and trendy
During pandemic COVID-19, WHO has made wearing masks compulsory to protect against this deadly virus. In this project I have develop a machine learning project â€“ Real-time Face Mask Detector with Python.

I have build a real-time system to detect whether the person on the webcam is wearing a mask or not. I will train the face mask detector model using Keras and OpenCV.
